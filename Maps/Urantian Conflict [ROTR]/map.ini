WaterTransparency
  TransparentWaterMinOpacity = 0.5 ;opacity of water at maximum depth - 1.0 is opaque, 0 transparent.
  TransparentWaterDepth = 3.0       ;depth below water surface at which it becomes opaque (unless clipped by TransparentWaterMinOpacity)
StandingWaterColor = R:255 G:255 B:255 ;material color used to tint the water surface.
  StandingWaterTexture = TWWater01.tga ; main texture used for water (usually something blue that looks like water).
  AdditiveBlending = YES; use additive blending instead of alpha blending?
  RadarWaterColor = R:207 G:240 B:243 ; color of water on radar display.
